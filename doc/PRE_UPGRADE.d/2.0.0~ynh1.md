There is no way to go back after a Planka migration to v2 without proper backup. In case of need, remember to archive the automatic backup which will not be done before the update.

Hosting under a path like https://example.domain/planka is currently not supported by Planka v2. Please migrate your installer to a subdomain before the update.

Migration to v2 is only possible from Planka 1.26.2. The update will be carried out in 2 steps if your current version of Planka is less than 1.26.2.
